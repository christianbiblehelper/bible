        <p>&ensp;&ensp;Our very first reading regards the start of the bible. So, genesis was a beginning for us in many ways. Hopefully it may be a beginning for our viewers: to have love enter their world. 
            <br>In the series I am about to start, I hope to welcome people to a place of comfort. 
            <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; Yes, a place of comfort, in its truest sense. To reach both these virtues, true and the 'comfortable',
            I will seek to write and talk by striking to the core and by being true.
            <br>I wish to find what's best for well-being, the spiritual journey and you the audience in particular.
            I wish you and myself welcome to this journey. It is of mine, it is of yours.
            <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; Let us start this road with these words. Thank you in advance for joining in on this road. Finding what the heart emplores</p>
