        <p class="MidText">I rather not give you my name. However, does it truly matter anyway? This is a nice discussion to have.<br><br>
            For now, I'd say my name is important, but my work is even more. In the end, you should know me by my true names (an inspirational poem by Thich Nhat Hanh). 
        <p class="MidText">In that light, perhaps you could call me Christian.

        <p class="RightText">A warm thanks for all the support I get from people. It gives me energy to carry on with my project. Since this is the beginning of my project, I thank my future audience in advance. I hope we will have a fruitful future together. Thank you </p>
